# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This project was to build a quiz from scratch with questions about JavaScript.

This was the most fun challenge at this point. I enjoyed bringing my own style and creativity into the challenge. Creating an application that is responsive, not just in design but in user experience and interactivity was certainly difficult at times but ultimately very rewarding!

I attempted to go above and beyond the acceptance criteria by adding additional features, such as difficulty modes and audio response for correct and incorrect answers.

The acceptance criteria was as follows:
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Usage and Features

I started this challenge by designing the layout I wanted for the mobile screen.

Once I had the design the way I wanted it was just a matter of building the document and stylesheet to bring to the screen. I built "containers" for the title, quiz, complete, and highscore screens and used JavaScript to dynamically apply a class of hide (display: none;) as needed.
